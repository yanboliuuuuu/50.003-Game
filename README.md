Cohort 2 Grp5

Game Play
Two players compete to collect the star with button controllers. 
Buttons control movments are : left, right, dash and jump. Double jump is not allowed due to the size of the android phone is relatively small and to make the game more competitive as players will not collect the stars as easily.
There are two type of stars, the first type is the normal star that worth 1 point. The second type is the special star that only gets relesased when one player hit the spike. This kind of star has different UI and is worth 2 points. Hence players can push their opponents to hit spikes to release such stars. All types of stars will show up at random locations for players to race to collect it. At any point of time, there will only be one star of each type.
