Cohort 2 Grp5

Game Play
Two players compete to collect the coins with button controllers. 
Buttons control movments are : left, right, dash and jump. Double jump is not allowed due to the size of the android phone is relatively small and to make the game more competitive as players will not collect the coin as easily.
There are two type of coin, the first type is the normal coin that worth 1 point. The second type is the special coin that only gets relesased when one player hit the spike. This kind of coin has different UI and is worth 2 points. Hence players can push their opponents to hit spikes to release such coin. All types of coin will show up at random locations for players to race to collect it. At any point of time, there will only be one coin of each type. 

Winning Condition:
The player that collects 20 coins first , wins.
